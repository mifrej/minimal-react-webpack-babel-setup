# Test Case
* Add any preferable style loader to current Webpack setup
* 'Wireframe' simple 2 column layout (left column as a sidebar, right as a content)
* Implement simple 'navigation' list in the left column
* Implement title + description 'element' in the content area, where the title when clicked will toggle the description
* Add at least 3 tests for created 'layout'

## Acceptence criteria

* Candidate should use the React components driven architecture
* There are no mockup provided, so this task is purely about prototyping
* The layout should be styled with default styling (most simple one) in whatever chosen preprocessor (or purely in css), but without any css frameworks like Bootstrap and the like
* JS implementation should be done with use of inbuild synthetic events in React and component state
* Tests should be written with provided setup (Jest, enzyme)
